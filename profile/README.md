## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

OpenPotato primarily comprises a number of API-first open data projects whose aim is to aggregate freely available data and publish it via open REST API interfaces.

### The Projects

Open Data APIs:

+ [OpenHolidays API](https://www.openholidaysapi.org/): Provides public and school holiday data for many countries via an open REST API interface.
+ [OpenPLZ API](https://www.openplzapi.org/): Public street and postal code directory for Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Liechtenstein via an open REST API interface.
+ [CodeListHub](https://www.codelisthub.org/): Public repository for code lists in OpenCodeList format, which is accessible via an open REST API interface.

Open Standards:

+ [OpenCodeList](https://openpotato.github.io/opencodelist/en/): A standardised JSON format for the generic representation of code lists.
+ [OpenT8](https://openpotato.github.io/opent8/): A standardised JSON format for representing complex timetable data.
+ [OpenE8](https://openpotato.github.io/opene8/): Standardisation of the exchange of administrative data in the education sector for all types of schools in Germany. 
+ [CSV Table Schema](https://openpotato.github.io/csv-table-schema/): A pragmatic approach for defining CSV schemas via JSON.

Tools:
