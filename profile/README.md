## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

OpenPotato primarily comprises a number of API-first open data projects whose aim is to aggregate freely available data and publish it via open REST API interfaces.

### The projects

Open data APIs:

+ [OpenHolidays API](https://www.openholidaysapi.org/): Provides public and school holiday data for many countries via an open REST API interface.
+ [OpenPLZ API](https://www.openplzapi.org/): Public street and postal code directory for Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Liechtenstein via an open REST API interface.

Open standards:

+ [OpenCodeList](https://openpotato.github.io/opencodelist/en/): A standardised JSON format for the generic representation of code lists.
+ [OpenT8](https://openpotato.github.io/opent8/): A standardised JSON format for representing complex timetable data.
+ [CSV Table Schema](https://openpotato.github.io/csv-table-schema/): A pragmatic approach for defining CSV schemas via JSON.

Tools:

+ [SQLDocs](https://github.com/openpotato/sqldocs): Creating nice looking MkDocs schema documentations for relational databases.
