## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

OpenPotato primarily comprises a number of small API-first open data projects whose aim is to aggregate freely available data and publish it via open REST API interfaces.

### The projects

+ [OpenHolidays API](https://www.openholidaysapi.org/): Provide public and school holiday data via an open REST API interface.
+ [OpenPLZ API](https://www.openplzapi.org/): Make a public street directory (including postcodes and municipal data) available for Germany, Austria and Switzerland via an open REST API interface.
+ [CSV Table Schema](https://openpotato.github.io/csv-table-schema/): A pragmatic approach for defining CSV schemas via JSON.
+ [SQLDocs](https://github.com/openpotato/sqldocs): A cross-platform console application for creating nice looking MkDocs schema documentations for relational databases.
